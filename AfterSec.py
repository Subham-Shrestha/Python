# for loop and while loop are the loops of python
# i = 0
# while i < 5 :
#     print("Hello world")
#     i = i + 1
# This loop runs until the value of i is 5
# The loop that never stops is infinite loop. Infinite loop is bad.
# names = ['ram', 'shyam', 'hari', 'rita']
#   i = 0
#   while i < len(names) :
#     p rint(names[i])
#       i = i + 1
# This loop prints the every name from names variable.
# For loop stops automatically after the value is undifined.
# names = ['ram', 'shyam', 'hari', 'rita']
# for item in names :
#     print(item.capitalize())
# break stops the loop forcefully. 
# names = ['ram', 'shyam', 'hari', 'rita']
# for correct in names :
#     # print(correct)
#     if correct == 'hari' :
#         print(correct)
#         break
# roll = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
# for six in roll :
#     if six == 6 :
#         print("Number found!")
#         break
# break stops loop permanently while continue connect the loop to next integration.
# numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
# for n in numbers :
#     if n % 2 == 0 :
#         continue 
#     else :
#         print(n)
